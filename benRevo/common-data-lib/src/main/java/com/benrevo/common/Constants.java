They are not agents or employees of Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company.</p><br /><p><strong>Choice of dentists</strong></p><p>While your dental plan lets you choose any dentist, you may end up paying more for a service if you visit an out-of-network dentist.</p><p><strong>Here’s why:</strong></p><p>In-network dentists have agreed to payment rates for various services and cannot charge you more. On the other hand, out-of-network dentists don’t have a contract with us and are able to bill you for the difference between the total amount we allow to be paid for a service – called the “maximum allowed amount” – and the amount they usually charge for a service. When they bill you for this difference, it’s called “balance billing.”</p><p><strong>How Anthem dental decides on maximum allowed amounts</strong></p><p>For services from an out-of-network dentist, the maximum allowed amount is determined in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li>Out-of-network dental fee schedule/rate developed by Anthem, which may be updated based on such things as reimbursement amounts accepted by dentists contracted with our dental plans, or other industry cost and usage data</li><li>Information provided by a third-party vendor that shows comparable costs for dental services</li><li>In-network dentist fee schedule</li></ul><p><strong>Here’s an example of higher costs for out-of-network dental services</strong></p><p>This is an example only. Your experience may be different, depending on your insurance plan, the services you receive and the dentist who provides the services.</p><p>Ted gets a crown from an out-of-network dentist, who charges $1,200 for the service and bills Anthem for that amount.Anthem’s maximum allowed amount for this dental service is $800. That means there will be a $400 difference, which the dentist can “balance bill” Ted.</p><p>Since Ted will also need to pay $400 coinsurance, the total he’ll pay the out-of-network dentist is $800.</p><p>Here’s the math:</p><ul><li>Dentist’s charge: $1,200</li><li>Anthem’s maximum allowed amount: $800</li><li>Anthem pays 50%: $400</li><li>Ted pays 50% (coinsurance): $400</li><li>Balance Ted owes the provider: $1,200 - $800 = $400</li><li>Ted’s total cost: $400 coinsurance + $400 provider balance = $800</li></ul><p>In the example, if Ted had gone to an in-network dentist, his cost would be only $400 for the coinsurance because he would not have been “balance billed” the $400 difference.</p><br /><p><strong>Effective Date</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This proposal assumes the effective date shown. Any change in the effective date will have an impact on the rates and requires a re-quote.<br /></p><p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Proposals assume we have been notified of all known disabled employees or dependents, either active or COBRA and large ongoing claims. If previously unreported conditions become known and are disclosed after the quote(s) are issued, Anthem Blue Cross reserves the right to revise the quote.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The employer group must have a minimum of 101 full time employees, including full time equivalents, to qualify for Large Group benefits and no more than 300 full time employees for this quote to be valid.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Eligibility is limited to all full-time employees working a minimum of 30 hours per week.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Retirees, 1099 employees and leased employees are not eligible.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Since Anthem is neither a Hawaii authorized insurer nor a Hawaii Health Care Contractor, our benefits may not match the requirements of the Prepaid Health Care Act. We recommend that you obtain direct quotes for either an individual policy for employees who live and work in Hawaii or if there are several employees within an employer group to obtain group coverage from a Hawaii authorized insurer. This would ensure that all the state requirements are met.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Proposals are invalid if the number of COBRA participants exceeds 10% of total enrollees at the time of enrollment.</p><br /><p><strong>Employer Contributions</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This proposal assumes the group's current employer contribution level, as noted in the Request for Proposal or other document provided by the broker and/or employer, will be continued through the next policy year. This applies to contributions for both employees and dependents. The contribution levels are shown on the Client Summary page of this proposal.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Our proposal assumes Anthem Blue Cross will not be disadvantaged relative to Kaiser from a contribution perspective. The contribution scheme must be the same from an employees' perspective for both Kaiser and Anthem. This proposal is to be considered null and void if this condition is not met.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Dual HMO Network proposals assume the employer will contribute the same amount for any combination of the HMO Traditional, Select HMO, Vivity HMO or Priority Select HMO. In the event there is a different employer contribution structure between any combination, rates may increase for one or both plans.</p><br /><p><strong>Rates</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>If the rate differential between any two PPO plans (Premier, Classic, Solution PPO, or Anthem PPO HSA) is greater than 35%, an adverse selection load may need to be applied at Anthem's discretion. For example, offering a PPO plan with a $250 deductible alongside a second PPO plan with a $3,000 deductible may result in a rate differential greater than 35%.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Anthem PPO HSA rates do not include the HSA Administrative bank fee. The group has the choice of either paying the banking fee on behalf of the member or allowing the member to pay directly. The banking fees, when paid by the group, are based on enrollment in the HSA product, not the actual accounts activated.</p><br /><p><strong>Benefit Plans</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The Summary of Benefits briefly describes the main features of Anthem Blue Cross's benefits. The benefits, limitations, and exclusions are described more fully in the individual booklet-certificate issued to each employee. The complete terms of coverage are governed by the group insurance contract issued by Anthem Blue Cross.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The group plan benefits purchased from Anthem Blue Cross must be communicated without modification to the members. A member's financial responsibility, including but not limited to deductible, coinsurance, co-payments, out-of-pocket maximums, or for non-par providers, the balance-billed charges must be paid solely by the member. The client may not partially pay, reimburse, or otherwise reduce the member's responsibility pursuant to the group plan.</p><br /><p><strong>Commissions</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The proposal assumes the commission levels shown on the Client Summary page.</p><br /><p><strong>General Provisions</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This contract will be sitused in California and will be governed by California state legislation.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>At this time, it is not known if additional guidance and clarification from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will require additional changes to benefits and rates. If so, we will communicate revised benefit and rate information as soon as it is available.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>We will rely on the assertions of the group to ensure the plan is in compliance with respect to The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) non-discrimination provision.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>An employer-employee relationship must exist for all eligible employees or the quote is invalid.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Any quoted Anthem Blue Cross rates will be considered void if offered alongside any carrier's age banded rates (i.e member level rating).</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>In the event of multiple proposals being issued on the same prospect, the rates developed based on the most correct information submitted (enrollment split between PPO and HMO, employee zip code, underwriting questionnaire, etc.) will apply. All other rates will be invalid. Any questions regarding this issue should be referred to the local Anthem Blue Cross Sales Office for resolution.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Standard Anthem Blue Cross administrative policies, practices, and contracts will apply, which includes the release of the renewal no earlier than 90 days in advance of the renewal date. Exceptions cannot be made.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Renewals will not be experience rated. Claims experience is not available.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Under final rules issued by EEOC under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, wellness incentives are subject to certain limits in some situations. Incentive limits may also apply under the Affordable Care Act. Employers are responsible for taking steps to comply with all legally-required incentive limits. Please consult your attorneys or advisors for additional information as needed.</p><br /><p><strong>Revision or Rescission of Quote</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Anthem Blue Cross will rely on the information provided to determine whether a proposal will be issued. The responses are assumed to be correct. You are obligated to provide correct information. If material errors or omissions are found after the quote(s) are issued, Anthem Blue Cross reserves the right to revise the quote in any manner or to rescind the quote even if you were unaware of the material error or omission.</p><br /><p><strong>Affordable Care Act</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Effective January 1, 2014, additional fee provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took effect. The ACA taxes and fees included in your premium rates in accordance with federal law are:</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>1. Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) Fee: $1 per covered life for plan years ending October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013; $2 per covered life for plan years ending October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014; and adjusted for medical inflation thereafter until it ends in 2019. This fee funds a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which examines the effectiveness, risks and benefits of medical treatments. It applies to fully insured and self-funded employer groups for medical coverage only. We are liable for the fee for fully insured customers and it has already been included under the retention for all quotes with policy years ending 10/1/12 and later.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>2. ACA Insurer Fee: This annual fee on health insurance, funds premium subsidies for the health care exchanges and Medicaid expansion. It applies to fully insured employer groups only for medical, dental and vision coverages. Since the fees change each year in January for all business no matter the renewal date, we have calculated the amounts on a prorated basis across your full coverage period. The ACA Insurer Fee is 3.38% for 2018 and 0% for 2017 due to the moratorium.</p><br /><p><strong>Dual Network Quotes - Traditional HMO / Select HMO / Vivity HMO / Priority Select HMO</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This Dual HMO Network quote assumes the employer will contribute the same for any combination of the Traditional HMO, Select HMO, Vivity HMO or Priority Select HMO. In the event there is a different employer contribution structure between any combination, rates may increase for one or both plans.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Our proposal assumes Anthem Blue Cross will not be disadvantaged relative to Kaiser from a contribution perspective. The contribution scheme must be the same from an employees' perspective for both Kaiser and Anthem. This proposal is to be considered null and void if this condition is not met.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>HMO network pairings are limited to two networks. Triple Option HMO network quotes are not available.</p><br /><p><strong>Anthem PPO HSA Plans</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The quoted Anthem PPO HSA rates do not include account fees associated with a HSA bank account that is an option with this product. If the group selects HSA administration of the HSA account, then the group has the choice of either paying, on behalf of the member, or allowing the member to pay the bank directly that portion of the total fee the employer chooses not to pay. All bank fees are in addition to the quoted HSA medical plan rates and, when paid by the group, are billed based on enrollment in the HSA product, not the actual accounts activated.</p><br /><p><strong>Biometric Screenings</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Effective January 1, 2017, CA Large Group Fully Insured Pooled Business (100-300) will Receive Embedded Biometrics at no Additional Cost</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Anthem has added a new, included benefit to our California fully insured, pooled 100-300 standard large group customers.
