		<br />
		<p>The in-network dental providers mentioned in this communication
			are independently contracted providers who exercise independent
			professional judgment. They are not agents or employees of Anthem
			Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Choice of dentists</strong>
		</p>
		<p>While your dental plan lets you choose any dentist, you may end
			up paying more for a service if you visit an out-of-network dentist.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Here’s why:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>In-network dentists have agreed to payment rates for various
			services and cannot charge you more. On the other hand,
			out-of-network dentists don’t have a contract with us and are able to
			bill you for the difference between the total amount we allow to be
			paid for a service – called the “maximum allowed amount” – and the
			amount they usually charge for a service. When they bill you for this
			difference, it’s called “balance billing.”</p>
		<p>
			<strong>How Anthem dental decides on maximum allowed amounts</strong>
		</p>
		<p>For services from an out-of-network dentist, the maximum
			allowed amount is determined in one of the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Out-of-network dental fee schedule/rate developed by Anthem,
				which may be updated based on such things as reimbursement amounts
				accepted by dentists contracted with our dental plans, or other
				industry cost and usage data</li>
			<li>Information provided by a third-party vendor that shows
				comparable costs for dental services</li>
			<li>In-network dentist fee schedule</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>Here’s an example of higher costs for out-of-network
				dental services</strong>
		</p>
		<p>This is an example only. Your experience may be different,
			depending on your insurance plan, the services you receive and the
			dentist who provides the services.</p>
		<p>Ted gets a crown from an out-of-network dentist, who charges
			$1,200 for the service and bills Anthem for that amount.Anthem’s
			maximum allowed amount for this dental service is $800. That means
			there will be a $400 difference, which the dentist can “balance bill”
			Ted.</p>
		<p>Since Ted will also need to pay $400 coinsurance, the total
			he’ll pay the out-of-network dentist is $800.</p>
		<p>Here’s the math:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dentist’s charge: $1,200</li>
			<li>Anthem’s maximum allowed amount: $800</li>
			<li>Anthem pays 50%: $400</li>
			<li>Ted pays 50% (coinsurance): $400</li>
			<li>Balance Ted owes the provider: $1,200 - $800 = $400</li>
			<li>Ted’s total cost: $400 coinsurance + $400 provider balance =
				$800</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the example, if Ted had gone to an in-network dentist, his
			cost would be only $400 for the coinsurance because he would not have
			been “balance billed” the $400 difference.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Effective Date</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>
			This proposal assumes the effective date shown. Any change in the
			effective date will have an impact on the rates and requires a
			re-quote.<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Eligibility</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Proposals assume we have been
			notified of all known disabled employees or dependents, either active
			or COBRA and large ongoing claims. If previously unreported
			conditions become known and are disclosed after the quote(s) are
			issued, Anthem Blue Cross reserves the right to revise the quote.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The employer group must have a
			minimum of 101 full time employees, including full time equivalents,
			to qualify for Large Group benefits and no more than 300 full time
			employees for this quote to be valid.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Eligibility is limited to all
			full-time employees working a minimum of 30 hours per week.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Retirees, 1099 employees and leased
			employees are not eligible.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Since Anthem is neither a Hawaii
			authorized insurer nor a Hawaii Health Care Contractor, our benefits
			may not match the requirements of the Prepaid Health Care Act. We
			recommend that you obtain direct quotes for either an individual
			policy for employees who live and work in Hawaii or if there are
			several employees within an employer group to obtain group coverage
			from a Hawaii authorized insurer. This would ensure that all the
			state requirements are met.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Proposals are invalid if the number
			of COBRA participants exceeds 10% of total enrollees at the time of
			enrollment.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Employer Contributions</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This proposal assumes the group's
			current employer contribution level, as noted in the Request for
			Proposal or other document provided by the broker and/or employer,
			will be continued through the next policy year. This applies to
			contributions for both employees and dependents. The contribution
			levels are shown on the Client Summary page of this proposal.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Our proposal assumes Anthem Blue
			Cross will not be disadvantaged relative to Kaiser from a
			contribution perspective. The contribution scheme must be the same
			from an employees' perspective for both Kaiser and Anthem. This
			proposal is to be considered null and void if this condition is not
			met.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Dual HMO Network proposals assume
			the employer will contribute the same amount for any combination of
			the HMO Traditional, Select HMO, Vivity HMO or Priority Select HMO.
			In the event there is a different employer contribution structure
			between any combination, rates may increase for one or both plans.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Rates</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>If the rate differential between
			any two PPO plans (Premier, Classic, Solution PPO, or Anthem PPO HSA)
			is greater than 35%, an adverse selection load may need to be applied
			at Anthem's discretion. For example, offering a PPO plan with a $250
			deductible alongside a second PPO plan with a $3,000 deductible may
			result in a rate differential greater than 35%.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Anthem PPO HSA rates do not include
			the HSA Administrative bank fee. The group has the choice of either
			paying the banking fee on behalf of the member or allowing the member
			to pay directly. The banking fees, when paid by the group, are based
			on enrollment in the HSA product, not the actual accounts activated.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Benefit Plans</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The Summary of Benefits briefly
			describes the main features of Anthem Blue Cross's benefits. The
			benefits, limitations, and exclusions are described more fully in the
			individual booklet-certificate issued to each employee. The complete
			terms of coverage are governed by the group insurance contract issued
			by Anthem Blue Cross.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The group plan benefits purchased
			from Anthem Blue Cross must be communicated without modification to
			the members. A member's financial responsibility, including but not
			limited to deductible, coinsurance, co-payments, out-of-pocket
			maximums, or for non-par providers, the balance-billed charges must
			be paid solely by the member. The client may not partially pay,
			reimburse, or otherwise reduce the member's responsibility pursuant
			to the group plan.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Commissions</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The proposal assumes the commission
			levels shown on the Client Summary page.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>General Provisions</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This contract will be sitused in
			California and will be governed by California state legislation.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>At this time, it is not known if
			additional guidance and clarification from the U.S. Department of
			Health and Human Services (HHS) will require additional changes to
			benefits and rates. If so, we will communicate revised benefit and
			rate information as soon as it is available.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>We will rely on the assertions of
			the group to ensure the plan is in compliance with respect to The
			Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) non-discrimination
			provision.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>An employer-employee relationship
			must exist for all eligible employees or the quote is invalid.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Any quoted Anthem Blue Cross rates
			will be considered void if offered alongside any carrier's age banded
			rates (i.e member level rating).</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>In the event of multiple proposals
			being issued on the same prospect, the rates developed based on the
			most correct information submitted (enrollment split between PPO and
			HMO, employee zip code, underwriting questionnaire, etc.) will apply.
			All other rates will be invalid. Any questions regarding this issue
			should be referred to the local Anthem Blue Cross Sales Office for
			resolution.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Standard Anthem Blue Cross
			administrative policies, practices, and contracts will apply, which
			includes the release of the renewal no earlier than 90 days in
			advance of the renewal date. Exceptions cannot be made.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Renewals will not be experience
			rated. Claims experience is not available.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Under final rules issued by EEOC
			under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information
			Nondiscrimination Act, wellness incentives are subject to certain
			limits in some situations. Incentive limits may also apply under the
			Affordable Care Act. Employers are responsible for taking steps to
			comply with all legally-required incentive limits. Please consult
			your attorneys or advisors for additional information as needed.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Revision or Rescission of Quote</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Anthem Blue Cross will rely on the
			information provided to determine whether a proposal will be issued.
			The responses are assumed to be correct. You are obligated to provide
			correct information. If material errors or omissions are found after
			the quote(s) are issued, Anthem Blue Cross reserves the right to
			revise the quote in any manner or to rescind the quote even if you
			were unaware of the material error or omission.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Affordable Care Act</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Effective January 1, 2014,
			additional fee provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took
			effect. The ACA taxes and fees included in your premium rates in
			accordance with federal law are:</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>1. Comparative Effectiveness
			Research (CER) Fee: $1 per covered life for plan years ending October
			1, 2012 through September 30, 2013; $2 per covered life for plan
			years ending October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014; and adjusted
			for medical inflation thereafter until it ends in 2019. This fee
			funds a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI),
			which examines the effectiveness, risks and benefits of medical
			treatments. It applies to fully insured and self-funded employer
			groups for medical coverage only. We are liable for the fee for fully
			insured customers and it has already been included under the
			retention for all quotes with policy years ending 10/1/12 and later.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>2. ACA Insurer Fee: This annual fee
			on health insurance, funds premium subsidies for the health care
			exchanges and Medicaid expansion. It applies to fully insured
			employer groups only for medical, dental and vision coverages. Since
			the fees change each year in January for all business no matter the
			renewal date, we have calculated the amounts on a prorated basis
			across your full coverage period. The ACA Insurer Fee is 3.38% for
			2018 and 0% for 2017 due to the moratorium.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Dual Network Quotes - Traditional HMO / Select HMO /
				Vivity HMO / Priority Select HMO</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>This Dual HMO Network quote assumes
			the employer will contribute the same for any combination of the
			Traditional HMO, Select HMO, Vivity HMO or Priority Select HMO. In
			the event there is a different employer contribution structure
			between any combination, rates may increase for one or both plans.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Our proposal assumes Anthem Blue
			Cross will not be disadvantaged relative to Kaiser from a
			contribution perspective. The contribution scheme must be the same
			from an employees' perspective for both Kaiser and Anthem. This
			proposal is to be considered null and void if this condition is not
			met.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>HMO network pairings are limited to
			two networks. Triple Option HMO network quotes are not available.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Anthem PPO HSA Plans</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>The quoted Anthem PPO HSA rates do
			not include account fees associated with a HSA bank account that is
			an option with this product. If the group selects HSA administration
			of the HSA account, then the group has the choice of either paying,
			on behalf of the member, or allowing the member to pay the bank
			directly that portion of the total fee the employer chooses not to
			pay. All bank fees are in addition to the quoted HSA medical plan
			rates and, when paid by the group, are billed based on enrollment in
			the HSA product, not the actual accounts activated.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			<strong>Biometric Screenings</strong>
		</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Effective January 1, 2017, CA Large
			Group Fully Insured Pooled Business (100-300) will Receive Embedded
			Biometrics at no Additional Cost</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Anthem has added a new, included
			benefit to our California fully insured, pooled 100-300 standard
			large group customers. Both our Know Your Numbers and Physician Fax
			programs will be embedded effective January 1, 2017.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>All our normal process-related
			steps still apply; The biometrics ordering timelines and worksite
			order form process must be completed to ensure the group receives the
			biometrics benefit. There is an 8-week lead time required when
			submitting an event request and services will be available to Anthem
			eligible members only.</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>Groups that elect to take advantage
			of the embedded biometrics will have the option of the following:</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 60px;'>- Your group can select only the
			Know Your Numbers Onsite Screening (available only at one onsite
			location with at least 25 employees)</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 60px;'>- Your group can select only the
			Physician Fax </p>
		<p style='padding-left: 60px;'>- Your group can select Both
			options: Know your Numbers Onsite screenings and Physician Fax</p>
		<p style='padding-left: 30px;'>What Are the Advantage of
			Biometrics? Health screenings provide a snapshot of an individual's
			current health status and provide insight on the impact of current
			lifestyle choices. Participating in health screenings helps employees
			take an important step towards better understanding their personal
			health and provides them another tool for making informed choices
			about how to proactively reduce their health risks.</p>
