            - If the initial quote is single option and two or more plans are sold as a multiple opion arrangement, an adjustment to the rates may be necessary.<br />
            - If the initial plan is an HRA, all alternates are also assumed to be the same type of HRA.<br />

            Quote Assumptions: The rates quoted are based on the following assumptions.  Changes to these assumptions may result in an adjustment to the rates or revocation of the quote.<br />
            - Rates are guaranteed for the contract period of 9/1/17 through 8/31/18.<br />
            - Rates are based on your submitted census.  UnitedHealthcare reserves the right to adjust the rates from audit date back to effective date if any of the following changes:<br />
            - Enrollment +/- 10%<br />

            - Average Contract Size +/- 10%<br />

            - This proposal assumes at least 73% of all benefit eligible employees (including spousal waivers) will enroll with United Healthcare.  If this assumption is not accurate, we reserve
            the right to requote back to original effective date.<br />
            - Unless otherwise stated, this offer replaces and renders all previous offers null and void.  New divisions must be evaluated by UnitedHealthcare prior to their addition to the plan.<br />
            - Renewals will be delivered 60 days prior to the anniversary date.  Rates and plan designs assume no changes in state or federal mandated benefits.<br />
            - If this quote is based off information provided from an RFP that did not include claims experience or renewal rates, final approval is contingent upon providing this information
            at the time the employer application is submitted. If the existing carrierâ„¢s combined renewal increase exceeds 20%, UnitedHealthcare reserves the right to re-rate. All large claims in
            excess of $25,000 or potential large claims have been disclosed.<br />

            for newly introduced Kaiser offering. For the initial year benefit designs, the second year policy period guaranteed premium, will increase by 9.9%, pre-ACA, conditional upon the
            employer population achieving a 35% participation and/or completion rate within both the Health Assessment and Biometric Screenings. Failure to meet participation and/or completion
            rates will increase the second year policy period guaranteed premium increase by 14.9%, pre-ACA. Eligible for a maximum of 4 benefit combinations of HMO and Select Plus products.<br />
