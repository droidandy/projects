BenRevo uses Auth0 for user accounts.  Here's how you get setup:

1. Ask Ryan to setup an admin account for you.  Your admin account (e.g. DemoAdmin@gmail.com) will be connected to a brokerage (e.g. DemoBrokerage)
1. Go to the [admin site](https://cryptyk.us.webtask.io/auth0-delegated-admin/login?returnUrl=users) and click the "Don't remember your password?" link to get an email with a password reset link.
1. Check your email and reset your password.  Now you have an admin account with your own password.
1. Go back to the [admin site](https://cryptyk.us.webtask.io/auth0-delegated-admin/login?returnUrl=users) again and login with your admin account (e.g. DemoAdmin@gmail.com)
1. This is the interface for all users in your brokerage (e.g. DemoBrokerage).  You can create new users here, as well as change their passwords.
1. Create a new user (e.g. DemoUser1)
1. Now launch the BenRevo app on your localhost and login with your new user (DemoUser1).  You'll see in the navbar dropdown for your users that they will all belong to your brokerage.
