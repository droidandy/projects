  <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Change - We have clarified that when Fashion Kanvas makes changes to the Agreement, the changes will not be retroactive.
    We also repeat here that if you do not like changes we make, you can terminate the User Agreement and must stop using the Services.</p>
    <p>Members - We clarified that registered users of our Slideshare branded services are also considered ìMembersî under this Agreement.</p>
  <h3>Obligations</h3>
    <p>We have moved the statement that you should not create an account using any false information or on behalf of others, including persons
      under the age of 16, into this Section.</p>
    <p>We clarify that service messages (and not just notices) can be sent to you either in product or through a message sent to contact information
      that we have for you. Our settings provide you choices about how we can contact you.</p>
    <p>We clarify that content that is shared by you through our Services, may be found off our Services. For example, previews or excerpts of content
      can be found in search engines of others. You can control how your content (or an excerpt) is shared by us off of our Services.</p>
  <h3>Rights and Limits</h3>
    <p>Where we had previously referred to a license to ìuse and shareî the content and information you share through our Services, we have added a reference
      to ìprocess.î</p>
    <p>When you take a social action (e.g., like, share or follow) we associate you with the content, companies or people that you took that social action on.
     If your settings allow for it, we will associate you and your social action with ads for others.</p>
    <p>When you choose to make your post a ìpublicî or ìpublic +î post (e.g., ìpublic + twitterî), other Members may use our ìembedî feature to share that
    ìpublicî post onto othersí services.</p>
    <p>Our Professional Community Guidelines have been renamed ìProfessional Community Policiesî to make it clearer that it is a collection of rules that
    apply to the use of our Services and that we seek to enforce them.</p>
    <p>A new section has been added to the User Agreement to better clarify how we use information and data we have about you to make recommendations to you
    and others, including to suggest jobs for you and to suggest you to recruiters.</p>
  <h3>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>Governing Law - We have changed the law governing this contract for some of our Members and Visitors. If you live in the US or a ìDesignated Countryî
      (i.e., European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland as of the date of publishing this summary), the governing law is not changing.
      For all others, the governing law will be UK law.</p>
  <h3>Fashion Kanvas ìDos and Donítsî</h3>
    <p>We have shortened Section 8 by consolidating some existing ìDonítsî and moving others that used to be in this Section into our newly renamed
      ìProfessional Community Policiesî (formerly Professional Community Guidelines). Both the terms of the ìDos and Donítsî and the Professional Community
      Policies continue to be part of this contract.Our Professional Community Policies have also been updated to reflect the addition of some of the ìDos and
      Donítsî that were removed from this Section 8 and to provide better clarity on what is okay or not okay in our professional community. So even though
      certain explicit references have been moved from the User Agreement into our Professional Community Policies, it is still not okay to do illegal,
      harmful, hateful or terrorist activity on our Services and it is still not acceptable to harass, shock, threaten or defame others, or to post or
      share content that is not truthful. Please review the Professional Community Policies for full details.</p>
