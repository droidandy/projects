She has been selling real estate in the Sound Shore communities of Larchmont, Mamaroneck and Rye for over 15 years. Before becoming a top producer with Julia B Sotheby's, Diana spent 10 years with Ted Bates Advertising in NY and London, managing global clients that included M & M Mars and Colgate Palmolive. The marketing skills she acquired during those years are important to her Seller clients as they inform the strategy she uses in staging, pricing and marketing their homes. Diana believes strongly that much of the work in selling a home, is done upfront. She spends a good deal of her time with her clients studying the market place, the competition and the buyers. She also spends a good deal of that upfront time helping her clients prepare their home for today's marketplace. Her resources are comprehensive and invaluable. On the part of Buyer clients, Diana's background in client service has meant a greatly appreciated level of attentiveness and professionalism. She knows that her buyers require 'up to the minute' listings and sales information as well as an agent that listens closely to what they are looking for. The financial and personal implications in buying a home are substantial and the decisions her clients make require time and thoughtful consideration. A respected and active member of her community, Diana served on the Board of The French American School for 9 years during which time her 4 daughters were students there. (They later attended Mamaroneck High School and Rye Country day School). Diana has been a strong supporter of the Leukemia Lymphoma Society, Cornell Weill/Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, The Larchmont Library and several Long Island Sound environmental charities. She founded the New Suffolk Waterfront Fund in 2005. Diana earned her BA in History from Vassar College. She is fluent in Greek and has a limited fluency in French and Spanish. She is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church of Our Saviour in Harrison NY and in her free time she loves to play golf, swim and garden.",

Specializing in the Greater New Haven area and the entire shoreline market area where she has lived since 1971, she is an expert at navigating clients through each step of the real estate process. As one happy client put it, \"I've worked with many realtors and you've simply been the best! Your knowledge of the market and adherence to my requirements regarding features and finances greatly expedited my long distance search for a home in Connecticut. That you were always available and stayed by me until closing was also much appreciated.\" Carol's success with her clients stems from her strong belief in always being prepared to accomplish anything in life. It is this philosophy that has guided her to her chosen paths of business from her work in mortgage banking in financing and management, to her years as a real estate paralegal for a major New Haven law firm. Her understanding of real estate combined with exceptional knowledge as a lifelong New Haven area resident gives Carol a distinct edge as the realtor of choice for anyone looking for a home in the Greater New Haven Area, including the Yale and Quinnipiac communities, as well as the shoreline neighborhoods in the towns of East Haven, Branford, Guilford, Madison, Clinton, Westbrook and Old Saybrook. As a member of the Real Estate Buyer's Agent Council, Carol holds a professional designation as an Accredited Buyer's Representative (ABR), a member of the National Assoc. of Realtors, the Connecticut Assoc. of Realtors, and the Greater New Haven Assoc. of Realtors. She is a former member of the Board of Directors for the Shoreline Chamber of Commerce and is presently serving as a member of the Board of Assessment Appeals for the Town of Guilford.

Each home, buyer, and transaction are different and I thrieve on seeing each one through the process from start to finish. Real Estate is not a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; profession. Each transaction requires a unique approach, working with a longtime homeowner that needs guidance and patience getting ready to downsize is different than the first time buyer that is excited to find their first home. The real estate market has become challenging over the last few years, with so many changes in searching and locating a property. Many factors can contibute within each transaction and it&rsquo;s important to be educated on them all. Insurance, mortgage and environmental factors all play into the home selling and buying process. I have knowledge in working with renters, sellers, and buyers to find the perfect property. So many of my past clients have become lifelong friends. I am pleased to offer my clients the exceptional marketing that William Pitt Sotheby&rsquo;s has to offer. Our company is always on the forefront of the ever changing real estate market and has exceptional marketing programs that fit every price range and type of home. As a lifelong Shoreline resident I am very familiar with the Shoreline area and all it has to offer. I have been a Branford Resident since 1987, raising my family here. It is with enthusiasm and professionalism that I look forward to working with each and every client.",

Contact information: (203)988-6983 cell dvaccaro@wpsir.com Donna's Reviews: CindyLu My boyfriend and I were in search of our first home. Donna was pleasant and helpful from start to finish! She was extremely patient in explaining all the processes to us and always ready to go the extra mile for our needs and wants in the house hunt. We are now in the home we fell in love with and Donna isn't just a realtor to us anymore, she's a friend! We are looking forward to keeping in touch with her and recommending her to all of our friends and family! Thanks Donna !!! You're a rockstar!!! Peter Z I met Donna via Zillow on line. I believe my first words to her I was just looking. Donna understood exactly what I was looking for and she provided some homes for me to look at. I whittled them down due to location, issues about the house I liked or disliked. This includes water well v public, septic v sewer, location, size of home and condition, I was willing to do some updating but was really trying not have much renovation but easily repairable properties. We looked at a few properties over a couple of weeks. When I walked into the home I finally bought I knew it then, if I could get the right price and cooperation from the current owner to pick up some of the repairs, after our inspector had reviewed the property would be very pleased. Donna recommended the inspector who was fantastic, knowledgeable and comes highly recommended by me as well as we did the inspection together instead of him just doing it himself. The inspector gave me a pad to write down the issues and it helped me understand all the issues that this gentleman was looking at including name, age and condition of the issues at hand. I knew how old the hot water heater, furnace, appliances, air conditioner unit etc. were. I feel if Donna Vaccaro had not been my Real Estate Agent I would still be looking for a home that I did not truly want for myself.. Donna has a true professional but has an outgoing personality which made me feel right from the start that she was the person I wanted to find me a home. She always returned my phone calls, text requests and emails very promptly. Daytime, after hours she was always responsive and a true hard worker. She kept me of her schedule but always was there when needed. She is an honest, friendly, knowledgeable agent and certainly a person I hold in high regard. I can find absolutely no faults with her process and applaud her work ethic. It took us less than a month to find the quality home of my dreams and at the price I wanted to spend for my future. Donna hit me a home run on this with her negotiating skills and the knowledge she had obtained in her chosen field, home area and life. I honestly do not believe it would have been this pleasurable to buy a home if it were not for Donna. Donna is a pleasure to work with and certainly is someone I have and will continue to recommend if you are buying or selling. I wish her the best and could not be more pleased a month into my new peaceful retreat. Tom B Donna was simply amazing and was very helpful when we relocated to CT. It was our first time renting a home in 30 years and we had a wonderful experience. She was patient and truly cares about her costumers. Her local knowledge was invaluable to our selection process.

Cowie is fortunate to have thoroughly loved both of his longtime careers - first as Vice President of North America for a large European paper group based in Stamford, CT and for the past decade, as a real estate specialist selling wonderful Connecticut shoreline area homes. While Peter sometimes still can't believe he gets paid for what he does, his greatest reward is not just the gratification he gets from his work; it's the appreciation he is shown from loyal clients, many with whom he's formed lasting relationships. While Peter enjoyed extensive travel to Europe for his previous position, he also always loved coming home to his beautiful waterfront home in Guilford. His enthusiasm and knowledge of the market have been evidenced by his standing for five consecutive years as the top one or two producer in sales volume for the area. Peter believes it's his passion for his community that shines through when showing customers around, and the fun he has selling real estate, that are his strongest sales tools. People feel comfortable working with him, because he takes them on tours of the different neighborhoods, educates them on the history of the area and the market, and lets them make decisions in their own time. Sometimes though, Peter will prod you to see a home you may not have otherwise considered, just because he knows his territory - and his clients' needs so well. In many of these cases, there have been offers on the spot! Peter heads a professional team, Peter W. Cowie and Associates, that covers that gamut of real estate services for clients seeking or selling properties on the Connecticut waterfront and inland. Since each home and situation near the water is so unique, he employs a custom approach to marketing and pricing that will draw the greatest demand. A resident of Sachem's Head in Guilford with his wife, Peter is an avid golfer, and a member of both the Clinton Country Club and Sachem's Head Yacht Club. He and his wife Jennifer also enjoy spending as much time as possible with their two sons, and two grandsons, who live just a few miles away.For eighteen years I was the North America Vice President for a major European Paper Group headquartered in Paris, France.

Living in Westchester for so many years has allowed me to develop an expertise in the communities of southern Westchester. I work with both buyers and sellers from the Rivertowns to the Long Island Sound and all towns in between. I appreciate all that Westchester has to offer and I enjoy the uniqueness of each of the different communities and areas. As a realtor, I have specialized in all types of residential properties and have successfully helped both buyers and sellers with their single family homes, condos and co-op apartments. In addition, I also specialize in residential rentals and have completed over 100 rental transactions in my career. I have helped clients relocate to Westchester from all over the US and overseas, including but not limited to Argentina, China, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Please feel free to contact me for both your local Westchester Real Estate needs and your out of Westchester and out-of-state Real Estate needs. I can help you no matter where you are leaving and where you are going! About Me & My Community Involvement: I have been active in the various schools and PTAs that my 3 children have attended. My involvement began at the nursery/pre-school level, and then on to elementary school involvement. I believe that each child's needs must be matched with the appropriate school experience. As a result, I have experienced both area public schools and private schools as I matched each of my children to the best program for their individual strengths and needs. I am also very active in my neighborhood association and a Board Member of the Association. I have chaired many different community events over the years including the Annual Progressive Dinner, as well as various events for children. I am an avid golfer and member of the Ladies Golf Association at my country club. I also enjoy cycling and recently partook in the NYC 5 Boro Bike Tour (40 miles) and the Westchester Golden Apple Ride (34 miles). I also enjoy spending time with family and friends.",

For the past 14 years, I have really enjoyed the pleasure of bringing buyers and sellers together and find it most gratifying when a successful conclusion is reached. I specialize in residential real estate in Westchester County, New York, but I can help you buy or sell real estate anywhere in the world. I have been selected to be in the Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty Producers Club for being in the top 5% of all producers industry-wide in Westchester County and in the top 20% of all producers within the entire William Pitt and Julia B.

I graduated from Harvard Law School with a J.D. after earning a B.A. in economics from Northwestern University where I earned Phi Beta Kappa honors. I worked as a Real Estate Attorney at the law firms of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson before becoming a full-time Associate Real Estate Broker. The expertise I gained as a real estate attorney has helped me provide outstanding service to my real estate clients looking to buy and sell single family homes, condominiums, co-ops and new construction/renovation. The negotiating skills that I perfected as a real estate attorney have been a tremendous help to my real estate clients in buying and selling their homes. I provide total transaction expertise to buyers from showing to closing and to sellers from listing to closing. I have lived in Westchester County for almost 25 years, and can provide the right mix of knowledge, expertise, experience and compassion to help you with your next move. I am active in my community and was heavily involved in the Scarsdale public schools when my three children attended.

It was then that I came to realize that while Manhattan is the best place on earth, I was a more balanced person when I was able to experience the peace, slower pace, and the absolutely joy of being around natural beauty. As an adult I found Litchfield County as my counterbalance to NYC and I have become its biggest advocate. I have been a part-time resident here for 10 years and I am constantly discovering new reasons to love it. Until recently I owned a Pilate&rsquo;s studio in New York which offered specialized and boutique services to a demanding clientele. Each client was unique so I customized the program to address his/her special needs. I know the key to any business success is understanding the customer needs and providing the best possible service to satisfy them. I am thrilled to be at William Pitt Sotheby&rsquo;s International Realty and a part of the highly regarded Goldspiel Group. The philosophy that Ira Goldspiel espouses is that each property deserves a customized marketing plan and a team of people who can best market, show and sell it. Each detail is important: photography, copy, advertising, exposure on the internet, weekly analysis of results and networking within and outside our organization. Goldspiel manages the process and selects the best local and corporate people to make it all happen. His superb record proves this approach works. If you are thinking of listing and/or selling a property I am eager to discuss and outline the process. Or if you just want an update describing the current marketplace and get our insights into where we think the market is heading, I would love to bring you up-to-date. Our resources are the best in the business and I look forward to being able to show you how William Pitt Sotheby's is the best brokerage to deliver your real estate needs.",

            "remark": "For me, being a Licensed Associate Real Estate Broker is about more than just buying or selling a home. It is about establishing relationships, and helpingbuyers and sellers achieve their goals. I have been representing both buyers and sellers in real estate transactions since 2004. I was Rookie of the year, during my first year in business. Buying or selling real estate is a business decision, in which emotion plays a big role. By choosing to work with me, you can be assured that I am reliable and a good listener. I am dedicated to providing my clients with guidance and patience throughout the entire process. Prior to my decision to enter the real estate field, I was a credit officer with a major Wall Street Firm, where I was responsible for making business recommendations based on the financial condition, and stability of large financial corporations. The analytical skills I acquired serve me well in my chosen profession, allowing me to assist both buyers and sellers in making educated real estate decisions. In addition, I have a mortgage banking background. I have lived in lower Westchester all of my life, and therefore I know the communities well. I currently live in the Edgewood section of Scarsdale with my husband and 3 children since 1992. I enjoy working out, figure skating, and spending time with my family. I am a dedicated volunteer at Kids Kloset, an organization committed to providing poverty stricken children in Westchester County with essentials. I am an active Member of the Scarsdale PTA.

            "htmlRemark": "For me, being a Licensed Associate Real Estate Broker is about more than just buying or selling a home.  It is about establishing relationships, and helpingbuyers and sellers achieve their goals.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I have been representing both buyers and sellers in real estate transactions since 2004.  I was Rookie of the year, during my first year in business.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Buying or selling real estate is a business decision, in which emotion plays a big role.  By choosing to work with me, you can be assured that I am reliable and a good listener.  I am dedicated to providing my clients with guidance and patience throughout the entire process.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Prior to my decision to enter the real estate field, I was a credit officer with a major Wall Street Firm, where I was responsible for making business recommendations based on the financial condition, and stability of large financial corporations.  The analytical skills I acquired serve me well in my chosen profession, allowing me to assist both buyers and sellers in making educated real estate decisions.  In addition, I have a mortgage banking background.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I have lived in lower Westchester all of my life, and therefore I know the communities well.

Her affinity for the shoreline began when she was a child, staying at her great-grandparents' home at Stannard Beach. Through her teen years, Sue enjoyed visiting friends and family at our many shoreline beaches. Having lived and worked in Stamford and NYC, Sue's knowledge of Connecticut is vast and extends beyond Fairfield and Hartford Counties. Sue has traveled internationally and met her husband while touring in Italy. Together, they lived in Antibes, France and sold luxury real estate on the Cote d'Azur. After experiencing life on the French Riviera, Sue and Alain returned to the shoreline where she focuses on waterfront properties and beach communities. Business Philosophy Sue's passion for real estate shows in her enthusiasm and commitment. Realizing that every buying and selling situation is different, Sue focuses on understanding each client's needs and desires. Honesty, integrity and service are in the forefront of all of her business dealings. Receiving holiday cards from buyers and sellers, years after closing, puts a huge smile on her face and is a true testament to Sue's customer focused philosophy. Whether the sale involves a waterfront mansion or a one-bedroom condo, Sue feels every client deserves the same commitment and dedication. She takes pride in working with buyers regardless of their budget and, even afterclosing, Sue is always available to assist clients in acclimating to their new home and community. Accomplishments Sue sold over $55,000,000 in real estate in Connecticut and the South of France. Her real estate experience began with listing and selling multi-million Euro properties on The French Riviera. Sue assisted International buyers with purchasing luxury properties ranging in price from 1&euro; to 15&euro; million. Prior to joining William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty, Sue worked for a national builder selling semi-custom single-family homes in Mystic and Southington, Connecticut. Sue has helped many clients with interior renovations and design. Although Sue began her career working with corporate clients from Fortune 1000 companies, she utilizes her sales experience, marketing expertise and excellent negotiating skills in her real estate transactions. Sue holds a Bachelor's degree from Tulane University and a Master's degree from American University. You can reach Sue on her cell phone anytime at 860.707.6879.",
