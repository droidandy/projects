This well-known heritage landmark was originally designed by Frederick Glennie in 1934, who was a former Sir Herbert Baker asistant. In 2005 the complex was converted into mixed use / residential, and now houses 15 apartments, mainly occupied by creative people using the dramatic spaces as both offices and homes. The original terracotta facade is adorned with ornate carvings of heraldic shields, natural motives and cherubs, and most units still feature original arch windows. Although the neighbouring building was once Africa’s tallest structure, you will never feel dwarfed in this space. Truly a unit with endless possibilities. Not only offers this single-level loft-style apartment high ceilings, gleaming Oregon Pine flooring, downlighters throughout and ample cupboard space. Above all it gives one space to enjoy living. The building itself is equipped with an elevator and an intercom system for further convenience, and it might be worth noting that it is probably the only dog-friendly building in the CBD.<br><br>Property features<br><br>Apartment<br><br>* 2 Beds<br>* 2 Baths<br>* 2 Receptions<br><br>* Historic Building<br>* Loft<br>* Light and Spacious<br>* Dog-Friendly<br><br>Download PDF<br><br>Share<br><br>* Facebook<br>* Twitter<br>* Google<br>* Pinterest<br><br>International sales department<br><br>Our expert property sales team provides in depth knowledge of international real estate across 5 continents recommending properties to match lifestyles and guiding buyers through every step of the property purchase process.
