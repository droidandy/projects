</div><p class="">A Texas-based business is changing the way structures are restored. Heritage Restorations, founded in
1997 by Kevin Eurkin, sources historic barns, disassembles them and restores them in new locations. Since the company
has a facility in Waco, many of the projects are completed in Texas.&nbsp;
</p><p class="">A good number of the barns Heritage restores are sourced from New England, where the team can find
structures that date as far back as 1700.
<br>
</p><p class="">"The first step is to look for old buildings in fields, the majority of them have been coming from New
York, others come from Canada," Heritage Farms' marketing manager D.K. Sun says. "We take them down piece by piece,
number them so each has their place and ship them to our two facilities, one in Texas. After that we power-wash them and
then we start doing our repairing and modifications.
</p><p class="">"Sun explains that the appeal for many of their customers is the historical value of the structures.&nbsp;</p><p
class="">"The best barns are 200 years and older," Sun explains. "The older barns, if it's in poor condition it's more
work to rescue it, but they have absolutely better craftsmanship.
</p><p class="">"Even with clients scattered across the country, the delivery is often the easiest part of the process,
since Heritage outsources the transport services.&nbsp;
</p><p class="">That doesn't mean it always goes smoothly for the company.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Among the toughest
projects in the company's history is "The Ohio Mill," a historic mill made of 100 percent oak wood.
</p><p class="">"In terms of craftsmanship, it's probably the most difficult building we've ever done with just manpower
because even the smallest pieces were very heavy," Sun says, describing the drive from Ohio to Virginia, where the mill
is now located. "The 18-wheeler's tire broke off a couple times because of the weight.
</p><h3>"Timeline and price</h3><p class="">Sun is reluctant to discuss pricing since the projects vary from $150,000
for a well-crafted 400-square-foot restoration to more affordable options. Barns are more or less expensive depending on
the size of the structure and the complexity of the restoration process.
</p><p class="">Another factor when it comes to pricing is the option of purchasing a combination of services, including
the company's design and architectural team, which can be bundled into one package.
