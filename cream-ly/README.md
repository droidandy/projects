# Welcome to Cream.ly development!
Cream.ly works on e-commerce platform [Shopify](http://shopify.com). Shopify customization based on themes
Cream.ly theme was based on [Slate Starter Theme](https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme) (and still carries over the legacy from it...)

Development has been done with the use of a dozen of freelancers for different pages or parts of the website, hence there is a lot of inconsistency and duplication as result...

We are moving UI  away from liquid templates to [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) components
which are located in  [src/srcipts/react-components](https://github.com/cream-ly/shopify_theme/tree/master/src/scripts/react-components)

migrated components can be viewed via [Storybook](https://cream-ly.github.io/shopify_theme/) or [Chromatic Library](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=5ece332374ccd50022465d2a)
