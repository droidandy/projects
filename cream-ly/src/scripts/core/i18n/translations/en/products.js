My baby (6 months old) had some kind of inflammation on the chest, nothing helped at all. Only your cream did! You can't imagine how happy I am that I found you! Once again, thank you very much for your work and knowledge :))\nI really want as many moms as possible (and not only!) to know about you! You just saved us!!❤️❤️\nTHANK YOU!!\",\n \n\"Alena, good afternoon. I want to tell you. The cream for atopic skin is just awesome. Eczema, which no other cream could cure, even a hormonal one, was cured in three days. I haven't had such soft skin on my hands in a long time. It wasn't always nice for the kids to hold my hand because of dry skin. Now we are holding hands:)\nThank you for your job. You have once again confirmed the title of magician❤️\",\n\"Dear Alena,\nThis body cream is truly magical! It's healed red spots under my knees! They appeared after I gave birth and stayed with me for 5 years !!! I've lost hope to get rid of them.\nI've applied your cream from time to time and lo and behold - the spots disappeared and the skin became softer.\nAnd also this body cream is so good for burns - not a scar on my hands now! \",\n\"Body cream is my salvation! My skin was so dry and itchy! What an unpleasant sensation! I've used so many moisturisers and nothing helped! And now I can go through the day without applying the cream at all, even after shower! I'm shocked, honestly! It's enough to use your cream 2 times a week and the skin simply does not ask for anything else - it's like I'm a child again! Thank you! \",\n\"The younger daughter gets dry and itchy behind the ear from time to time, doctors said - it was eczema and prescribed hormonal ointments🥺. Just imagine, it's all over🙂\nThank you very much, it's such a pity that I've been looking at your posts and even reviews for two years, and I kept buying pharmacy products😢\",  \n\"Thank you very much for the body cream! My husband and daughter love it, my husband's fingers crack and hurt very much every winter. At first he resisted (because he tried so many things and nothing worked), but still gave in. He used in just twice - and his hands don't hurt anymore!\"\n\nMy daughter had a very dry and irritated skin in the mouth area and on her cheeks for about 2 month - I've used the cream twice on her and her skin is much better! My daughter said that this is her cream now and she really appreciated the box with a purple insert as well (my favourite colour).\n\nI am so happy that I even forgot that I was buying the cream for myself :) And after writing this I will go and put some on.\n\nThank you! I have always dreamed of writing an enthusiastic review of some product, not for Instagram, but from my heart. This is the first time!\",\n\"I want express my admiration to Alena and say how happy I am with the creams! The Body cream is like the most delicious piece of a dish that you usually eat last so that you can properly enjoy it! Or like that famous cherry on the cake! Like my favourite socks ... well, something like that!! It's like a hygge!! But that's not all! Today I found a grey hair, my grey hair ... a year ago I would have 100% panicked ... but today I told it \"heyyyyy\" and said that it looked nice!!! I just turned 30 ... and finally I accept myself ... and for that I need to say a huge thank you to this blog in which my abstract thoughts, conjectures, unformed guesses have got their shape, their foundation, their clarity! Hence the greater acceptance of myself !!! Thank you !!! ❤️ \",\n\"I want to thank you for the wonderful body cream! My whole family uses it! It helped my 2-years-old daughter to cure eczema and to fight skin dehydration. For me it reduced peeling and healed my husband's cracks on his hands. Our skin is so grateful to you! And I want to say special thanks for that you help us love and accept ourselves and our skin. I often reread your posts, they are charged with a very special energy \",\n\"I've never seen anything like this, it's like my skin magically soothes and heals.\",\n\"Since the beginning of the quarantine hands have been exposed to alcohol in antiseptics.\n\nMy 8-year-old child has “burned” the skin on his hands and they had dry crusts and even were bleeding for several month.\n\nYour cream has cured it in a few days\",\n\"Alena, couldn't wait to post this review about the body cream. My husband is a climber. After a week of working on the street with ropes and glands, his hands have become so dry and scratchy like a sandpaper. When he touches me through clothes, I shudder because I'm very sensitive. Yesterday before going to bed I tried the body cream and put a little amount on his hands as well. And OMG!\nYour cream is now a main sponsor of the male tenderness in our family💚 \",\n\"I want to share my thoughts about the body cream with you 🙂 My heels squeak with delight and just demand to tell the world that your body cream is life-saviour and a miracle! If you understand the difference between dried fruits and delicate apricots, then you understand my joy! ❤️ After a shower I wipe my heels with a towel, and it remains perfectly clean since I started to use  your cream. There is not a single cell of dry skin! Is it even possible?! Alena, you create magic! ❤️❤️❤️\n\nAnd, of course, it's so great that it turned out to be light and nice. It is instantly absorbed and does not leave greasy marks (for me it is very important, I used to use oils after a shower and, oh God, how my bed linen suffered from it). Although I did not doubt for a second! 🙂 \",\n\"Good morning Alena. I would like to share the results of the body cream treatment:)\nWe have been using it for a week, and not only the legs but on whole body to heal the spots, and wow! the spots are almost gone☀\nMy child loves the cream, because it smells like lemon :))\nThank you\nWe ourselves did not expect it to help us so quickly. \",\n\"I've ordered your body cream before. It's just magical\" I had very dry skin, that was peeling off. But now it doesn't. How is this possible ?! \"I also used the cream on my face, although I don't usually do it. The effect is amazing! I was looking for this kind of brand -  natural and honest (and not as usual where you buy a series of 10 products to achieve some kind of result) 😊 I'm glad I found you 😊 \",\n\"I wanted to record a video for you from my husband, but didn't have time yet. I immediately took the body cream and put it on my husband's hands for the night because his hands were awful: so many crusts from coffee and sanitiser. He wasn't happy, but endured it,\" What does your Alena put in it ???? My hands healed overnight !!!! I wasn't even sure in the morning if these were my hands))) Well done! 😂😂 Is there anything to make his tummy go away?\nHere's a first-hand review, so to say 😂\nI began to put this cream on my face: it became much better in a couple of days as well! 🥰 This is my new love))) \",\n\"Alena, hello! Thank you so much for what you are doing. Recently, I have received my body cream and I am 1000% satisfied with it, Never happened  with any similar product! I stopped using a scrub and a washcloth, and my skin became at times softer🥰 \"\n\n\"I confirm 100%!❤️❤️❤️ Not a single, not even a single tiny stretch mark! Throughout my pregnancy I've been using this cream and my skin is delighted🥰 Now I bought it for my mom, friends, sister and now I want to buy more - but the website says it's already over)) next time I'll buy it in bulk😄 Thank you very much for such a product, and for the service with a soul ❤️\",\n\"Recently I saw that my daughter (9 months old) had eczema on legs and arms, I put your cream on her skin just a couple of times after bath and it took the eczema away. Before that the eczema itself did not go away for a couple of months. We are very impressed!

    "linen": "<div class=\"title\">\n<h2>ABOUT LINEN</h2>\n</div>\nLinen is an environmentally friendly fiber. We love the fact that it is a fairly hardy and pest resistant plant with a low level of detrimental impact on the environment. Flax has many properties. It is a strong and durable fabric that is breathable and highly absorbent. Contrary to the popular belief that it is customary to wear linen clothes only in the hot season, we can say that linen clothes are universal. You can wear it absolutely at any temperature outside the window. It is especially important for us that linen clothing is an excellent choice for those with very sensitive or even allergic skin.\n<br/><br/>\nThere is almost no waste in the production of flax. After processing, the residues are used as fuel, and some are exported in the form of briquettes. Also, very useful flaxseed oil and various dietary supplements are produced from flax seeds in Belarus.\nHigh quality, local raw materials and production, environmental standards are important arguments in favour of the material we use.",
