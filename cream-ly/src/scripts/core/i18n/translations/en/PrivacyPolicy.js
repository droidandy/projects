  "cookie_statement": "<h1>COOKIE STATEMENT</h1>\nThis statement is about our cookies and similar technologies. The cookies we use are analytical cookies with a limited intrusion on the privacy of our website visitors. We use these cookies to analyze and to improve the use of the website. Because of this limited intrusion into your privacy, we are not obliged to ask for your permission via a cookie notification.\n\nTo ensure that cookies have a limited intrusion into privacy, we have taken several protective measures.\n\nCookies are only stored for a limited period. Often this is limited to the duration of the session.\n\nFor more information about the type of cookies, the specific functions they perform, the parties that place these cookies, and the retention periods, please read the full cookie statement.\n\n<h2>Analyzing the website</h2>\nTo analyze and improve the use of our website and how visitors have come to our website, we place analytical cookies on your device. For this we use Google Analytics. The software creates visitor statistics based on these cookies. We do not share these statistics with third parties.\n\nWhat exactly happens during the website analysis?\n\nWhen you visit our website for the first time, the software will see your IP address. Your IP address will then be marked ('visitor A1' for example). This so that the IP address when visiting a next page or a subsequent visit can still be recognized by that feature. We will then anonymise the IP address itself. Doing so, you can no longer be traced back to the IP address. This is a measure that ensures that, on the one hand, your privacy is better protected and, on the other hand, that we are still able to 'count' unique visitors.\n\nBy means of the website analysis, we collect the following data, linked to the anonymised IP address (/our characteristic):\n\n- city and country (of the IP address),\n- Browser type (Firefox, Chrome, Explorere, Safari etc),\n- Operating system (Microsoft, Apple, Android, etc.)\n- The presence of plugins (such as Acrobat or Flash Player),\n- Pages visited, how long the visit lasted and when they were visited.\n- Used links to access our website ('refferrers').\n- Used links on our website that refer to external websites.\n- Other information, such as screen resolution and website speed. This is in - order to be able to show the website properly on both mobile phones and laptops and to be able to optimise the website if it does not work fast enough.\n\n<h2>Privacy measures</h2>\nTo protect your privacy, we have taken the following privacy protection measures. Google Analyitics taken the following measures: before Google have the IP addresses saved in the software, we have the last two octets of each IP address deleted (so we only see the following: 192.168.xxx.xxx). In the case of the privacy-friendly variant of Google Analytics, it can still be traced back to a group of max. 256 computers (at IPV4), with which it is still a personal data according to the Authority Personal Data.\n\nBecause the impact of our analytical cookies on our website on your privacy is very limited, you do not have to give permission for this.\n\n<h2>Do Not Track</h2>\nIf you do not want us to place cookies on your device, we recommend that you enable the Do Not Track feature in your browser. Our software will not place cookies.\n\n<h2>Change of cookie statement</h2>\nWe may change our cookie statement. If so, we will make an announcement of this change on our website. If we want to substantially change the purposes of the processing, and the processing is based on your consent, we will first ask you again for consent for those new purposes.",

We use the following bases for our various processing operations:\n\nPermission: to be able to contact you if you ask us.\nWhen you, as a customer, buy products from us or want to do this, and we must necessarily process your personal data in order to be able to do so.\nLegal obligation: if we receive a legitimate claim to provide data to a competent authority.

Processors may only process personal data on our behalf and under our supervision, only for purposes we determine and under strict confidentiality. We actively monitor compliance with the security obligations of our processors. Our processors come from the European Union, or have a relevant branch in the EU, which means that they must comply with the GDPR. We therefore do not pass on any personal data to countries where your personal data is less well protected..\n\n<h2>STORAGE PERIOD OF THE DATA</h2> \nWe do not store personal data for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which we obtained it. We base this assessment on the type of personal data, the product or service for which we have obtained the data, and what you, as the data subject, can reasonably expect as a retention period.\n\nIf we wish to retain your data for a longer period, for example for future vacancies, we will ask your permission.\n\n<h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>  \n\nWe have enabled encryption on the traffic to our website. This makes the data traffic between you and our web server unreadable, so that outsiders have no access to it. Of course, we also make sure that we secure your data in an appropriate way in all our systems. We do this with all kinds of technical measures, including physical security of access to our office, but also with organisational measures. For example, with access control, we ensure that only authorized accounts, such as administrators, can access the participant accounts.\n\n<h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>  \n\nPursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to inspect your personal data on request and, if necessary, to amend them or have them deleted. In addition to the right of access, correction, and deletion, you may ask us to restrict the processing of personal data and it is possible to object if you disagree with the processing. Finally, in some cases it is possible to invoke the right to data portability. We do not use automated individual decision-making, such as profiling.\n\nAt the top of this PRIVACY POLICY is how you can contact us to exercise your rights. To verify your identity, we may ask a number of identifying questions, for example.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to lodge a complaint with the Authority for Personal Data.
