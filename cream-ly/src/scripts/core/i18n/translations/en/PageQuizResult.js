  "feedbacks": "[\n\"By the way! I used to apply cream to the entire skin after every shower, because my skin was terribly tightened/dried. Using your products, I stopped doing it! I only apply the cream several times a week. After the beach. Or to separate parts of the body. And the same thing with the face!!! I can wash my face with the powder in the morning and do not apply ANYTHING else on my face. I highlighted it in large letters. Because earlier, the morning and evening looked loke this: cleanser -> toner -> serum -> face cream. Please, post my comment here. I really want to shout to every woman that it's possible to live in a completely different way. Saving a lot of money, time and effort. Because we have your products. In general, I'm your devoted fan and every week I remind you of this and I won't get tired of this ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§\",\n  \n\"Alena, I've told you more than once and I'll tell you again. Thanks to you, I began to change and I began to think of myself and the beauty of women in a very different way. About the fact that a lot of girls, women have forgotten what it is to be yourself, and not to disguise yourself! Your cosmetics are more than just a cream! It's a step to new knowledge, change of stereotypes and just love and respect for all women! Because with only putting a cream on, the problem won't be solved! I completely changed my diet, I read ingredients, I'm not going to put any tester from the store on my face, just so it doesn't spoil). I don't wear makeup everyday like I used to. And I don't do many, many things I used to do! You changed me, and I'm very excited about this change! I wish you'd never lose that love you share with all of us üíú\",\n\n\"Alena, I want to thank you for creating such a magic!\n\nAfter giving birth, my skin became very sensitive, loose in some places and covered with a rough crust after using my normal skincare. I just couldn't look at myself in the mirror.\nSo, I decided to give your products a 1-month trial, as you said \"Skin needs time\". But it didn't take that long to see the difference ... It's pure magic! After a couple of days I noticed an improvement. My skin has become smoother, my pores have decreased, I started to admire what a saw in the mirror. And the scent ... OMG ... and it feels amazing.\n\nThank you very much! You are a fairy! \",\n\"Alena, well, I've started to use your products and after a little more than a month something happened, something I was waiting for for 12 years. I left the house without nothing on my face but a thin layer of powder. And it was okay! I really like mine face now. And all of this is possible thanks to your skin protection system \",\n‚ÄúThank you for your awesome products. I have been using them since September and I'm in love!\n \nAnd your massage courses, wow, they saved me!\nI panicked when my face began to change and I'm not even 40.\n \nI do massage 3 times a week and I recognised the difference after just 2 weeks.\",\n\"I am very pleased with the facial treatment, I have not visited a beautician for a year!\n\nThank youüëç \",\n\"Good afternoon! Today I had an appointment with my beautician and she  recognised a great improvement in my skin üòáüôè I used Creamly powder, exfoliate, cream for mixed acne-prone skin and sometimes oils only for a few months - and already - no new pimples and no subcutaneous inflammation too!\nIt's now time for me to switch to a cream with different composition, I really want my skin to get everything it needsüòäüôå\n\nYour compositions are pure magic!!! Sometimes there is even no need to use a cream after your powder! üòäüôè and my skin texture has changed for better during this time, it's become smoother, cleaner, even. This is love üòÖ‚ù§ \",\n\"I want to thank you again, I've been using cream and exfoliate for 5 month already.\nYou can't imagine how much money I've spent in the last 13 years looking for a skincare product that would work for me, It's crazy! Every time I bought a new thing, next day it went into a trashcan.\n\nBut in the last 5 month I haven't bought anything new, I haven't even thought about it.  My happiness is beyond all the words I can come up with. You really save my family budget)))) \",\n\"Good evening Alena !! I'm here today to tell you that what you are doing is an illegal miracle, just in case you don't know. ;)\nAnd it's so said that some people still doubt this magic!\nI've been using the Flower Powder and the Cream for 4,5 month. I use the cream only once, sometimes twice a week because I literally feel like the powder is enough. The skin is bright, soft and  glowing like my nine month old baby's.\n\nEveryone says that I'm girted with a good skin by nature but we know the truth - you are my fairy godmother, lots of hugs for you and your team!!!! \",\n\"Alena and Natalya, I want to leave you an extremely enthusiastic review of the video courses on lymphatic, buccal massage and posture. Girls! These are so awesome!\n \nVideos on anatomy are ESPECIALLY valuable, because it helps to understand what is for what, gives and inspiration to follow routine regularly and assures you that you are doing everything right, which means there will be a result!\n \nNatalia demonstrates and explains so well!\nGreat shooting, sound, music!\nLet many, many women take video courses for themselves and return their natural beauty to their faces as well as use your gorgeous products!\n \nAll the best‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n]",
