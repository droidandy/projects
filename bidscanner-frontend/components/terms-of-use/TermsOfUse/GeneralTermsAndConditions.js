      The Organization shall assign the role of "Administrator" to one of its Associates to register on

      the Organization to the Terms (Tradekoo is not supposed to check this requirement) and be older than 18
      years (or higher, if requested by local Laws).
    </P>
    <P>
      The Administrator signs up the Organization providing an email address and a password (which become the
      access credentials for the Organization). As the sign-up process is completed, and Tradekoo has verified
      the provided data, the Organization becomes an active User on Tradekoo. The Administrator shall provide
      true, accurate, valid and complete information about the Organization and maintain such information
      true, accurate, valid, and complete. Tradekoo is entitled to suspend Users that have provided untrue,
      inaccurate, invalid, or incomplete information at registration or after the registration or that
      register on the Site with multiple accounts. Tradekoo may also reject a registration and deactivate an
      account for any reason or no reason.

      The Administrator manages the Organization on Tradekoo and can create new accounts and their access
      credentials, under the same User, for any other Associate requiring access to the services of the Site

      update passwords regularly, log-out at the end of any work session, do not share the password with other
      Associates and / or Users and take any other initiative to protect the unauthorized use of the
      credential by malicious Third Parties. In no case and no event shall Tradekoo be liable to the User for
      any direct and indirect damage caused by the violation of the User account by any Third Party. It is
      responsibility of the User, and not of Tradekoo, to implement any hardware and software solution, and /
      or internal security procedure and / or access controls, to prevent such violations and the consequent
      possible unauthorized access to the account(s) by Third Parties.
    </P>
    <SubSection>6. Subscription Fees and Payments</SubSection>
    <P>
      Tradekoo may offer service on trial basis (“Free Trial”) to any newly registered User. User shall
      subscribe and pay one of the paid-plans to use the Site upon expiry of the Free Trial services, but has
      no obligation to do so.
    </P>
    <P>
      The structure, the value and the duration of the subscription fees ("Subscription Fees") are published,
      and kept updated as they change, on the pricing pages of the Site. The amount of the fees published on
      the Pricing page of the Site has a general nature and reflect a "normal" usage of the functionalities of
      the Site for any given plan: Tradekoo reserves to charge extra fees to any User that generates an above
      average volume of activity on the Site. Tradekoo also reserves the right to apply different fees to
      different group of Users, depending on its marketing and commercial plans. Each plan may differ in terms
      of Site features that can be accessed by different groups of Users. Tradekoo may change the services
      included in each plan by updating the conditions of the plans on the pricing page of the Site. Tradekoo
      may also apply special fees to user specific features of the Site to all Users or groups of Users.
    </P>
    <P>
      Unless otherwise indicated, Subscription Fees are due upon commencement of the subscription term in full
      and grant access, once paid, to the paid services of the Site. Subscription Fees shall be paid in the
      currency elected by Tradekoo, and User shall bear any currency conversion expense, if any.
    </P>
    <P>
      User is informed and agrees that Tradekoo may block, permanently or temporarily, the access to the Site
      to any User with overdue payments or rejected credit card payments.
    </P>
    <P>
      If the User upgrades to a higher plan during the subscription term, in case such option is given to
      Users, any incremental charge is payable as the upgrade takes place. The plan is charged at the upgraded
      value in any consecutive subscription term. No refunds or credits are due by Tradekoo if User elects to
      downgrade the subscribed plan, for the already executed payments. User is informed that the downgrade of
      the subscription plan may cause loss of content, loss of features and / or capacity of the service.
    </P>
    <P>
      Subscription Fees paid by credit are shown on the User’s credit card statements. In case a subscription
      plan is subscribed online, User hereby authorizes Tradekoo to bill the credit card in advance, on
      recurring basis in accordance with the terms of the service plan until the subscription is terminated by
      the User according to the provisions set herein. Tradekoo uses a third-party credit card processing
      gateway to process credit cards, and is not responsible for any fault experienced by Users due to such
      gateway.
    </P>
    <P>
      User may terminate the account at the end of each subscription term or earlier. Unless the account and
      the subscription to the Site is terminated by the User, the subscription to the Site renews
      automatically for a subscription term equivalent, in time, to the then expiring subscription term.
      Unless otherwise provided for in any form, the Subscription Fees applicable to the subscription for any
      such subsequent subscription term shall be the standard subscription charges for the service plan to
      which User has subscribed at the time such subsequent subscription term commences.
    </P>
    <P>
      No refunds or credits for subscription charges, or other fees or payments, shall be provided in case the
      User elects to terminate the subscription to the Site or to cancel the account prior to the end of the
      then effective subscription term. Following the termination or cancelation of the subscription to the
      Site and/or account, Tradekoo reserves the right to delete any User’s data with no obligation for
      Tradekoo to hand over the data generated by the User before the termination in whatsoever format.
    </P>
    <P>
      Tradekoo also has the right (but not the obligation) to suspend or terminate any account for any
      feature, product or service because of User inactivity for a certain period at Tradekoo’s discretion.
    </P>
    <P>
      If a User terminates his/her subscription to the Service or cancels his/her account prior to the end of
      his/her then effective subscription term or Tradekoo effects such termination or cancelation, in
      addition to other due amounts, User shall pay immediately any then unpaid charges associated with the
      remainder of such subscription term until the date of termination or cancellation. Such amounts shall
      not be due and payable in the event User has terminated the subscription because of a material breach of
      these terms by Tradekoo, provided that Tradekoo has not resolved such breach within ninety (90) days
      from the date of notification (notification to be given within three business days from the date of the
      breach).
    </P>
    <P>
      Generally, the Tradekoo Fees published on the pricing page of the Site do not include any tax, levy,
      duty or similar governmental assessments, including value-added tax, sales tax, use tax or withholding
      tax assessable and applicable by any jurisdiction outside of Switzerland. Users, and not Tradekoo, are
      responsible to assess whether any such tax shall be charged by Tradekoo, and their values, and therefore
      added to the fees. Users, and not Tradekoo, shall verify the compliance of the Tradekoo’s invoices and
      charges with local fiscal Laws and Regulations. Shall some taxes be found applicable to the Tradekoo
      standard fees, such taxes shall be borne and paid by the User promptly upon receipt of the amended, or
      corrective, invoice from Tradekoo.
    </P>
